# Morning Planner

## Description

The objective for this weeks assignment was to implement jQuery and Bootstrap into our files to create a planner. I decided to go with a morning activities planner, one where you can list activities you would like to do between the hours of 8am to 3pm, have those saved on the screen and pulled up whenever revisiting the site or refreshing the page
